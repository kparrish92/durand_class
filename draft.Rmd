# Praat

.large[
- PRAAT: A program to analyze and extract acoustic data
]

--

.large[
- What can it do with sounds? 
 - Record  
 - Analyze 
 - Segment 
 - Extract 
 - Synthesize 
 - Manipulate 
]

# Record sounds

.pull-left[
.content-box-blue[
.large[
-- Open PRAAT 

-- New - Record mono sound

-- Press "record" and say anything

-- Press "stop" after recording

-- Label the sound "sound_1" under "pat".

-- Press "Save to list"

- Click "Sound sound_1" in the PRAAT objects window 

- Click "view and edit"

# Analyze sounds 


.pull-left[
.content-box-blue[
.large[
- What do you notice about the waveform? 

- We have three sounds (or segments), can you identify where /a/ is?

- Why do you notice that's different about the vowel compared to the rest of the word?

.large[
- It's voiced - and it's periodic 

- The dark portion of the spectrogram is an acoustic correlate of our vocal folds vibrating as we produce voiced speech sounds!

# Segment sounds 

.pull-left[
.content-box-blue[
.large[
- We can also segment sounds 

 - Click your sound object in the PRAAT object window 
 - Select "Annotate", then "To TextGrid..." 
 - Erase all text in the pop-up window 
 - Type "word, segment" in "All tier names" and press OK
 - Click and drag to highlight BOTH you Sound and TextGrid
 - Click View and Edit

# Segment sounds 

.pull-left[
.content-box-blue[
.large[
- Here, we can actually segment the word and each sound (segment)

- This way, it's possible to extract durations or specific acoustic paramenters from what we are interested in studying. 
]]]

---

# Segment sounds 

.pull-left[
.content-box-blue[
.large[
- Segment the sound by clicking on a specific point and pressing "enter" to enter on boundary

- You can click to select an interval once you have inserted a boundary and type to label it 

- We could analyze or even extract a selected sound this way

# Extract a sound 

.pull-left[
.content-box-blue[
.large[
- With your sound and TextGrid open, select the sound /a/ by clicking it 

- Click "file"

- Click "Extract Selected Sound (preserve times)

- We have that sound in our Objects window!
]]]

---

# Combine sounds 

.pull-left[
.content-box-blue[
.large[
- We can combine sounds, too. 

- Select at least two sounds 

- Click "Combine-" and then "Concatenate"

- The sounds are combined now!
]]]

---

# Speech synthesis 

.pull-left[
.content-box-blue[
.large[
- PRAAT also has the ability to synthesize speech 

- New - Sound - Create SpeechSynthesizer - Choose Language and Voice variant - click OK

- Select "SpeechSynthesizer..." from your Praat Objects window - to sound - type any text, such as "I like chickens". - Click OK

- Now, we have a robot voice producing this sentence as a sound in our Praat Objects window.

# Sound manipulation 

.pull-left[
.content-box-blue[
.large[
- Let's make a statement a question 

 -- Select Sound - manipulate - To manipulation -  OK -
 
 -- Pitch - Stylize pitch (2 st) - Change the dot positions - close the window - Get resynthesis
 
-- Play the sound again - does it sound like a question?

# That's all!

.pull-left[
.content-box-blue[
.large[
- We learned, in Praat, how to.. 
  - record a sound
  - annotate that sound 
  - Extract a sound 
  - create a synthetic sentence 
  - Manipulate the pitch of an utterance 
]]]

.pull-right[
.content-box-red[
.large[
- There is a ton more! You can actually script in PRAAT to automate these processes on a large number of sound files.
